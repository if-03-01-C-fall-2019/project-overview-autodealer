            <ul>
              <li>The purpose of this website is to let you know the background of these 3 brands.</li><br>
              <li>And also that we help those who cannot decide which car to buy mailto (in the future, as the first car).</li>

        <h3>Why are we taking this topic?</h3>
          <p>
            We took this topic because we are interested in cars at all and the 3 brands are our favourites.
            That's why we agreed on the three and wanted to create a common website for the brands.
            We also wanted to compare the cars you like with the ones you like, because it's very practical to
            see how the cars differ from each other from the brands.

        <h4>Our plans</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Each brand has its own section and this section contains the history of the websites.</li><br>
            <li>A separate section for comparing cars.</li><br>
            <li>A game where you steer a car, where many cars meet and you as a driver have to dodge.</li><br>
            <li>At the end the original websites of the brands are shown, where you can also press on it.</li>
